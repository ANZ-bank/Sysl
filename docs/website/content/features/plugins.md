Sysl has a VSCode extension which provides syntax highlighting for `.sysl` files. Install it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ANZ-BANK.vscode-sysl).

We also have the following on our roadmap:

- GoLand Extension
- Sublime Text Extension

If you would like to see an extension for your favourite text editor, you're more than welcome to make a PR!
