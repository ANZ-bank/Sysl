Several commands require environment variables to be set before they are able to correctly work.

## SYSL_PLANTUML

`export SYSL_PLANTUML=http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml`

For more details, refer to [Install](/docs/install/)

### SYSL_MODULES

`export SYSL_MODULES=true` is a flag to indicate whether Sysl modules are enabled. By default, if this is not declared, Sysl modules are enabled.
