Sysl consists of two executables: `sysl` and `reljam`.</br> The **Sy**stem **S**pecification **L**anguage `sysl` is mainly concerned with diagram creation whereas the **Rel**ational **Ja**va **M**odel program `reljam` generates different types of source code output.

Sysl outputs
------------
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| data    | Data model diagrams |
| ints    | Integration Diagrams |
| sd      | Sequence Diagrams |
| pb      | Binary Protocol Buffer files of the Sysl definitions (plugins)    |
| textpb  | Text based Protocol Buffer files of the Sysl definitions (plugins, debugging) |


Reljam outputs
--------------
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| model   | Java model implementation (in memory) |
| facade  | Java facade implementation (restricted access to creating and populating models) |
| view    | Java implementation of Sysl model transformations|
| xsd     | XSD representation of Sysl model |
| swagger | Swagger representation of REST APIs and models |
| spring-rest-service | Java Spring REST API implementation |

Sysl samples
------------
`sysl` can generate diagrams and Protobuf representations of the `*.sysl` input.

### ints

### sd

### data

### textpb
Protocol buffers is a "language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler". It is a strongly typed binary format used as intermediate representations of Sysl definitions comparable to an abstract syntax tree. The strongly typed protocol buffers are supported in most major programming languages.

Please refer to our developer documentation on how to compile the Protobuf definitions to your preferred porgramming language in order to [create your own Sysl extension]
(https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl#extending-sysl). If you want to generate human readable, text-based Protobuf output use the `textpb` command.

For the following contents of `hello.sysl`

```
HelloWorld:
    !type Message:
        text <: string
```

the command

	sysl textpb hello.sysl --out hello.textpb

generates a `hello.textpb` file. Its contents are

```
apps {
  key: "HelloWorld"
  value {
    name {
      part: "HelloWorld"
    }
    types {
      key: "Message"
      value {
        tuple {
          attr_defs {
            key: "text"
            value {
              primitive: STRING
              source_context {
                start {
                  line: 4
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
