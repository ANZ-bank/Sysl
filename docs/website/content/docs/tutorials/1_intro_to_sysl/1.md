The Sysl syntax is indentation based.
A most basic Sysl file looks like this:


Stage 1:
```
HelloWorld:
    /endpoint:
        GET:
            returns string
```


```
Query parameters:

Endpoint which takes a variable name `postId` of type `int` and returns a Post type
```
HelloWorld:
  /comments:
    GET ?postId=int:
      return Post
```
