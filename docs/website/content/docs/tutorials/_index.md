# Language Guide

Sysl is a system specification language (and toolkit). You describe applications and data models that make up your system and use `sysl` commands like `sd`, `ints` and `data` to render sequence, integration and data diagrams. Sysl can be extended using plugins. `reljam` is a plugin that reads intermediate representation generated by `sysl` to generate Spring based Java RestController for your API defined in sysl. `gosysl` is another plugin that generates `go` stubs for the same api definition.

Your complete system can be described as forest of trees, where one tree represents one application or data model.

Sysl uses indentation to represent parent child or `has` relationships. E.g. an  `application` has `endpoints` or a `table` has `columns`.
