functions: 
views are the functions of sysl.

a simple view signature is:

!view ViewName(varName <: varType) -> returnType:
    varName -> (:
        out = ToLower(varName)


`->` can be interpreted as `transforms into` and is used in different context's. 
`varName -> (:` is used to parse the `word` parameter into the namespace of the view. 
`varName -> (element:` can be used if the input type is a sequence and a stream like behaviour is needed. This will iterate through all `element` in `varName`.

```
!view AllToTitle(names <: sequence of string) -> <sequence of string>:
    names -> (name:
        out = ToLower(name)
```
